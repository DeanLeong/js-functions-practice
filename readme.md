# Functions Lab

## Introduction
> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

Let's practice writing some functions! 

This exercise includes **unit tests**, so you'll be able to see instantly if your functions work properly by running tests, and passing them.

### Getting Started

1. Fork this repo into your account.
1. Once the forking is complete, **clone** the repo onto your computer.
1. From the command-line: 
    - `npm i` (this will get all the tools necessary for this exercise).
1. Open `functions.js`
    - Each function and its behavior are described in the comments
    - All the function names are already inside the file; you just need to implement the function by adding code inside each one.
    - Additionally, you can take a look at the full [function documentation].

### Writing Code and Running Tests

Run one of the following commands in the Terminal (in this folder):

|  To see tests in the terminal...|
|----|----|
| run `npm test`|
| Watches for changes; <br> no reload necessary; <br> `ctrl-c` to quit|

  - The tests will initially fail (red).
  - Correct functions will cause the tests to pass (green).


  Of course, you can also run your code directly if you like, with:
  ```bash
  node fuctions.js
  ```

### Deliverable

When you've completed the lab, 
1. Commit it and push to Github Enterprise. 
2. Create a pull request with your solution.
