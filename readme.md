# Functions Practice

### Getting Started

1. Fork this repo into your account.
1. Once the forking is complete, create a feature branch, and **clone** the repo onto your computer.
1. From the command-line: 
    - `npm i` (this will get all the tools necessary for this exercise).
    - `git checkout -b solution` to start working on a new solution.
1. Open `functions.js`
    - Each function and its behavior are described in the comments
    - All the function names are already inside the file; you just need to implement the function by adding code inside each one.
    - Additionally, you can take a look at the full [function documentation].

### Writing Code and Running Tests

Run one of the following commands in the Terminal (in this folder):

| To see tests in the browser... | To see tests in the terminal...|
|----|----|
| run `npm start` | run `npm test`|
| Reload to see changes | Watches for changes; <br> no reload necessary; <br> `ctrl-c` to quit|

  - The tests will initially fail (red).
  - Correct functions will cause the tests to pass (green).

### Deliverable

When you've completed the lab, 
1. Commit it and push to Github Enterprise. 
2. Create a pull request with your solution.
